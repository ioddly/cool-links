# Cool Links.

A simple link shortener, written with Flask and Intercooler. The goal was just to see how far I could get without
writing any JS.

Writeup is here: [JavaScript without JavaScript](https://upvalue.io/javascript-without-javascript-intercooler-js/)

## Running

```shell
FLASK_APP=app.py flask run
```
